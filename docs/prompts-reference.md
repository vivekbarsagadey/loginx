- [Acceptance criteria]

Follow LoginX patterns:
- Use themed components (ThemedView, ThemedText, ThemedButton)
- React Hook Form + Zod validation for forms
- Firebase actions in actions/[module].action.ts
- Expo Router for navigation
- i18n for all user-facing text
- Local-first with utils/local-first.ts

Expected:
- Working implementation in correct directories
- TypeScript types in types/
- JSDoc comments
- Zero TS errors (check with get_errors)
```

**LoginX-Specific Example**:

```bash
@developer implement OTP login screen

Requirements:
- 6-digit OTP input with auto-focus
- Phone number input with country code
- Resend OTP after 60 seconds
- Rate limiting (3 attempts per 15 min)

Structure:
- File: app/(auth)/otp-login.tsx
- Component: components/auth/otp-input.tsx
- Hook: hooks/use-otp-verification.tsx
- Action: actions/auth/verify-otp.action.ts
- Validation: Zod schema for phone + OTP

Follow: app/(auth)/login.tsx for screen structure
```

---

### Code Refactoring

```bash
@developer refactor [file/module] following best practices

Focus:
- Split large components (<200 lines)
- Extract custom hooks
- Add React.memo where appropriate
- Replace 'any' with proper types
- Add missing error handling
- Implement i18n for hardcoded strings

Maintain: Backward compatibility, existing tests
Verify: get_errors, runTests after changes
```

**LoginX-Specific Example**:

```bash
@developer refactor app/(auth)/login.tsx to use LoginForm component

Extract:
- Form logic ‚Üí components/auth/login-form.tsx
- Social buttons ‚Üí components/auth/social-sign-in-buttons.tsx
- Validation ‚Üí constants/validation.ts

Keep: Screen layout, navigation, biometric section
Result: Cleaner screen component (<100 lines)
```

---

### Performance Optimization

```bash
@developer optimize [component] for mobile performance

Issues to address:
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Large bundle size
- Slow initial load
- Memory leaks

Solutions:
- React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Code splitting (React.lazy)
- Image optimization (expo-image)
- FlatList for long lists

Measure: Before/after with React DevTools Profiler
```

**LoginX-Specific Example**:

```bash
@developer optimize app/notifications/index.tsx for 1000+ notifications

Current issues:
- Using ScrollView (renders all 1000 items)
- No item memoization
- Expensive date formatting on every render

Apply:
- Replace with FlatList (virtualization)
- React.memo for NotificationItem
- useMemo for date formatting
- Pagination (20 items at a time)

Expected: 87% render time reduction
```

---

## üî¨ Monitoring Phase: Testing & Quality
