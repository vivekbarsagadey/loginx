Per the project's Documentation Best Practices:

1. **Completion reports** - Kept as proof of testing and verification
2. **Implementation guides** - Valuable reference for understanding past
   decisions
3. **Security audits** - Important for compliance and audit trail
4. **Migration guides** - Helpful if rollback or pattern review is needed

**Note:** Merged documentation (Typography System, Responsive Design) has been
deleted as the information is now integrated into `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
