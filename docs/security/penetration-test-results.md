### TASK-115: Injection Attack Testing

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### SQL/NoSQL Injection Attempts

```javascript
Test Payloads:
- "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
- "' OR '1'='1"
- "admin'--"
- "$ne: null"
- "{ $gt: '' }"
- "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
```

**Result**: All injection attempts blocked by:

- `sanitizeUserInput()` function (TASK-018)
- `validateFirestoreQuery()` checks (TASK-017)
- Firestore Security Rules validation (TASK-019)

#### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

```javascript
Test Payloads:
- <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
- <svg/onload=alert(1)>
- javascript:alert(1)
- <iframe src="javascript:alert(1)">
```

**Result**: All XSS attempts neutralized by input sanitization

#### Path Traversal

```javascript
Test Payloads:
- ../../../etc/passwd
- ..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32
- ....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

**Result**: All path traversal attempts blocked

### TASK-116: Rate Limiting Effectiveness

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Login Brute Force Attack Simulation

```
Test: 100 rapid login attempts from single IP
Expected: Rate limit triggered after 5 attempts
Actual: Rate limit triggered after 5 attempts
Result: ✅ EFFECTIVE
```

#### Registration Mass Account Creation

```
Test: 50 account creation requests in 1 minute
Expected: Rate limit triggered after 3 registrations
Actual: Rate limit triggered after 3 registrations
Result: ✅ EFFECTIVE
```

#### IP-Based Rate Limiting

```
Test: Distributed attack from 10 different IPs
Expected: Each IP rate limited independently
Actual: Each IP tracked separately, all rate limited
Result: ✅ EFFECTIVE
```

### TASK-117: Secure Storage Verification

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Biometric Credentials

- ✅ Stored in `expo-secure-store` with AES-256 encryption
- ✅ Keychain (iOS) / KeyStore (Android) integration
- ✅ No plaintext credentials in AsyncStorage
- ✅ Proper cleanup on logout

#### JWT Tokens

- ✅ Access tokens stored in secure storage
- ✅ Refresh tokens encrypted
- ✅ Token expiration enforced (1 hour access, 7 days refresh)

Actual: Re-authentication prompt triggered
Result: ✅ EFFECTIVE
```

#### Concurrent Sessions

```
Test: Login from 2 devices simultaneously
Expected: Both sessions valid, logout affects only one
Actual: Works as expected
Result: ✅ EFFECTIVE
```

#### Session Hijacking

```
Test: Attempt to use stolen JWT from different device
Expected: Token validation fails (device fingerprint mismatch)
