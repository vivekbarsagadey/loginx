# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem

Users had to log in every time they opened the app because Firebase Auth was
configured with `inMemoryPersistence`, which doesn't persist authentication
state across app sessions.

## Root Cause

In `firebase-config.ts`, the React Native auth configuration was explicitly set
to use `inMemoryPersistence`:

```typescript
// OLD - PROBLEMATIC CODE
auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: inMemoryPersistence // ❌ This causes login state to be lost
});
```

## Solution

Removed the explicit `inMemoryPersistence` setting to allow Firebase Auth to use
its default React Native persistence mechanism, which automatically uses
AsyncStorage to persist authentication state.

```typescript
// NEW - FIXED CODE
auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  // ✅ No persistence specified - Firebase uses default AsyncStorage persistence
});
```

## What This Fixes

### Before (Broken)

- ❌ User had to log in every time they opened the app
- ❌ Authentication state was stored only in memory
- ❌ App restart = lost login session

### After (Fixed)

- ✅ User stays logged in across app sessions
- ✅ Authentication state persists using AsyncStorage
- ✅ App restart = user remains logged in
- ✅ Logout properly clears the persisted state

## Technical Details

### React Native Default Persistence

Firebase Auth in React Native automatically provides persistence through:

- **AsyncStorage**: Stores auth tokens securely on device
- **Automatic refresh**: Refreshes tokens when needed
- **Secure token storage**: Handles token security automatically

### Web Persistence

For web, explicitly using `browserLocalPersistence` to ensure users stay logged
in across browser sessions:

```typescript
setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence);
```

### Cache Clearing on Logout

The logout function properly clears:

- Firebase auth state: `firebaseSignOut(auth)`
- Secure storage: `clearSecureStorage()`
- Pending profile data: `clearPendingProfileData()`

## Files Modified

1. `firebase-config.ts` - Removed `inMemoryPersistence` configuration
2. `hooks/use-auth-provider.tsx` - Enhanced logging and auth state handling
3. `docs/AUTH_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Login to the app
2. Force close the app (not just background)
3. Reopen the app
4. User should remain logged in ✅

## Security Notes

- Authentication tokens are still stored securely by Firebase
- Logout properly clears all stored authentication data
- No sensitive user data is persisted beyond what Firebase handles automatically
- Secure storage for app-specific data remains encrypted with SecureStore
