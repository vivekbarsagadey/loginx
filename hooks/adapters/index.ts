/**
 * LoginX-Specific Hook Adapters
 *
 * This module contains LoginX-specific adapters that integrate
 * portable hooks with project-specific dependencies (Firebase, constants, utils).
 *
 * These adapters allow core hooks to remain framework-agnostic while
 * providing seamless integration with LoginX infrastructure.
