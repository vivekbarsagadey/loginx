/**
 * Timing & Scheduling Hooks
 *
 * This module exports hooks for time-based operations:
 * - Debounced callbacks - Delay execution until after inactivity period
 * - Throttled callbacks - Limit execution frequency
 * - Intervals - Periodic callback execution with controls
 * - Timeouts - Delayed one-time callback execution with controls
 *
 * These hooks provide declarative, React-friendly wrappers around
 * JavaScript timing functions with automatic cleanup and control methods.
