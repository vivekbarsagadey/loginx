/**
 * Storage & Persistence Hooks
 *
 * This module exports hooks for data persistence:
 * - Local storage (AsyncStorage wrapper)
 * - Secure storage (SecureStore wrapper for sensitive data)
 * - Enhanced async storage with in-memory caching and TTL
 *
 * All hooks provide a React state-like interface with automatic
 * persistence and loading of initial values.
