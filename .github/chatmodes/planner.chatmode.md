# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

- Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
- Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
- Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
- Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.
