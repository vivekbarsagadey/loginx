## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Successful Migrations (What's Working)

**Phase 5: Storage Hooks - COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ All AsyncStorage direct calls eliminated
- ‚úÖ 3 auth flow files using useAsyncStorage
- ‚úÖ 9 total useAsyncStorage implementations
- **Result**: 100% storage migration success

**Phase 3: Timing Hooks - 70% Complete**
- ‚úÖ All 7 setInterval ‚Üí useInterval migrations complete
- ‚úÖ 4 of 10 setTimeout ‚Üí useTimeout migrations complete
- ‚úÖ 18 total timing hook implementations
- **Remaining**: 6 setTimeout calls (3 in verify-2fa, 3 in examples)

**Phase 4: State Management - 50% Complete**
- ‚úÖ 4 screens successfully using useToggle
- ‚úÖ 12 total useToggle implementations
- **Remaining**: 15 boolean states across 11 files identified for migration

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Opportunities Identified (What Can Be Improved)

**useToggle Migration - 15 States Ready**
```
Onboarding:    3 states (slideTransitioning, accessibilityEnabled, isRecoveredSession)
Auth Screens:  7 states (loading, checking, showBackupCodes, etc.)
Dashboard:     3 states (loading, refreshing)
Profile:       2 states (initialLoading)
```

**setTimeout Migration - 3 Critical Calls**
```
app/(auth)/verify-2fa.tsx: 3 calls (lines 43, 97, 103)
```

**Testing Gap - Critical**
```
Current:  <5% test coverage for hooks
Target:   60%+ test coverage
Missing:  20+ test files needed
```

**Documentation Gap - Critical**
```
Current:  1/4 docs complete (HOOKS_REFERENCE.md exists)
Missing:  HOOKS_ARCHITECTURE.md
Missing:  HOOKS_BEST_PRACTICES.md
Missing:  HOOKS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
```

### üî¥ Unused Hooks (Exist But Not Adopted)

**Lifecycle Hooks** - 0% adoption
- usePrevious
- useUpdateEffect
- useIsMounted

**Data Structure Hooks** - 0% adoption
- useList
- useMap

**Performance Hooks** - 0% adoption
- useDebouncedCallback (exists but unused)
- useThrottledCallback (exists but unused)

**Reason**: Hooks exist in codebase but no use cases have been implemented yet.
