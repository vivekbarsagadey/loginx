# Disable the warning about ignored build scripts
# by not running untrusted build scripts automatically
ignore-scripts=false

# Enable pre and post scripts
enable-pre-post-scripts=true

# Note: The build script warning is a pnpm security feature.
# These packages need build scripts but are ignored by default.
# This is generally safe - the packages build native modules or tools.
# If you want to allow all build scripts, you can set:
# ignore-scripts=false (already set above)
# Or approve specific packages with: pnpm approve-builds
